Dynamic Programming
*************************************

SECTION Dynamic Programming
    1. A method for solving complex problems by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and storing those solutions 
    2. Must have an Optimal Substructure - Its optimal solution can be contructed from optimal solutions of subproblems
    3. Must have Overlapping Subproblems - It can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times
    4. Memoization = Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning cached result when input reappears

SECTION Tabulation
    1. Storing result of previous result in a table/array
    2. Provides better space complexity
