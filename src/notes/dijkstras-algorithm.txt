DIJKSTRAS ALGORITHM
*************************************

SECTION Dijkstras Algo
    1. Most widely used algorithms around
    2. It finds the shortest path between 2 vertices in a graph (fastest way from point A and B)

SECTION Approach 
    1. Pick the node with the smallest known distance to visit first
    2. Once we have the node look at each of its neighbors
    3. For each neighboring node, calculate distance by summing edges that lead to the target node
    4. If the new total distance is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance
