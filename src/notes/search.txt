SECTION Linear Search on arrays
    1. Look at each index to see if it matches what it is you're looking for.
        - indexOf
        - includes
        - find
        - findIndex

SECTION Binary Search on sorted arrays
    1. Data must be sorted for binary search to work
    2. Determines if target is greater or less than middle and uses that as new chunk to search 
    3. O(log n) big o notation
